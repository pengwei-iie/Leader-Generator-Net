it was his only one .
he was in a bad temper .
he will be angry .
he saw the happy hunter searching about on shore .
he was against it because of the change in occupations .

he bore his brother 's scornful scolding with humility and patience .
he wanted his own hook back .
because of his virtues .

a stick .
he thought it was either in the sea or swallowed by a fish .
near by on the shore .

at the bottom of sea .
he suggested the happy hunter tell ryn jin what his trouble is and ask him to .

he will go down to ryn gu and tell him what his trouble is .
he promised to reward him as soon the hunter found his hook .
a boat .
it went through the water of its own accord .
he saw the gate and roof of sea king s palace .
he expected a long distance , but it was much shorter than that .
red coral .
it was covered in moss and had sloping roofs .
it was fast closed .
in a tree overhanging the well .
he thought that someone would come to draw water from the well .
he was surprised because they were not from the world where dragons and similar creatures lived .
he was surprised .
golden buckets .
draw water .
he saw them approaching the well , and they were about to draw water .
they saw the face of a handsome youth in deep still water .
they saw the face of a mortal man .
their curiosity .
they were frightened .
he sprang down from the tree and said: i am a traveler .
they were thirsty .
he raised it to his forehead of respect and pleasure .
he drank the water .
surprise .
princess tayotama was the eldest daughter of ryn jin .
they were the daughters of ryn jin .
he is happy to meet ryn jin because his father will be pleased .
it was very rare mortals visited the sea king s palace .
it was very rare .
all his courtiers and servants .
robes of ceremony .
they were cordial and polite .
they were chosen because of their beauty .
music .
the happy hunter forgot his troubles .
he asked his subjects if they had seen the lost fishing hook .
they arranged themselves and their fins in order .
he was sick and could not eat .
his face was pale and he looked half their usual size .
he was ill .
he snapped at a bait .
to return it back the mikoto .
the cuttlefish .
overjoyed .
he did not want to make more trouble for the tai .
ryn jin forgave his subject at once .

three years .
the sea king s kindness grew with time .
he will go back to his country and brother .

a farmer .
because they were very sweet and fragrant .
he was angry .
he called the bonze names .
give the bonze one of his smaller pears and let him go .
he bought a pear and gave it to the bonze .
he thanked him and said that it was beautiful .
he will plant a seed to grow the pear .
it will sprout and grow into a tree .
he ate too many pears .
he was repulsed .
he mingled with the crowd .
he turned around to look after his cart .
he felt rage .
he fell into a rage .
the bonze had divided his pear tree .
he saw the missing piece of his cart axle .
burst out laughing .
